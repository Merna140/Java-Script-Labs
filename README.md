# JavaScript Labs Repository

Welcome to the JavaScript Labs repository! This repository contains a series of JavaScript labs that cover various concepts and skills. Each lab is designed to help practice and enhance my JavaScript programming abilities.

## Labs Overview

<!-- Lab1 -->
### Lab 1: Simple trail using prompt and alert
<!-- ![Lab 1](./images/lab1.png) -->

### Lab 2: Age validation, Vowels counter and 24 hour clock to 12 Conventer
<!-- ![Lab 1](./images/lab1.png) -->

**Description:**
The lab is divide in to three parts

**First Part:**
Ask the user to enter his age. You must validate the user input (positive numbers only)
 Show the status of the user knowing that
 Child is between 1-10

 Count the number of vowels in that string (a,e,o,u,i) 

**Third Part:**
Write a JavaScript program to convert the 24 hour clock to 12 , adding am or pm based on its value.
 Examples 
0 -> 12AM,
 11 -> 11AM,
 13 -> 1PM

### Lab 3: Simple Login, Calc and Phone book
<!-- ![Lab 1](./images/lab1.png) -->

**Description:**
The lab is divide in to three parts

**First Part:**

**lab1 (Login):** User will enter his Username , Password 
If username = “admin” and password = “421$$” 
Show him message “Welcome login success”
If he entered incorrect username or password
Tell him which data entered wrong

**lab2 (Calc):** 
User will enter first number
Then enter an operation (sum,multi,subtract,division,moduls)
Then enter second number
Then do the operation and show the result to user

User will be able to use the last result to do new operation on it
As example user enter 1 then sum then 3 then show 4 then sum then 5 then show 
9 and so on

**Demo:**

**Second Part:**

**lab1:** Calculate the Sum and average Of the user entered values,
Ask the user to enter how many number he wants to get the sum of,
Save the number in array,
Show him the sum and average of the entered values.

**lab2 (Phone book app):** 
Ask the user for operation through JS prompt,
If user enters “add”,
Ask him for the name of the contact and phone number,
Then create js object for that contact and add it to contacts array,

Use 10 of Arrays predefined methods and explanation.
Ex3:
Write a nested function and explain the closure -> lexical environment.

<!-- Lab4 -->
### Lab 4: Implementing Constructor functions, Classes, Objects Linking to Other Objects (OLOO), Factory functions
<!-- ![Lab 1](./images/lab1.png) -->

**Description:**

Person:
-	Attributes (full name, money, sleep mood, health Rate)
-	Methods (sleep, eat, buy)

Implement Person methods:

# JavaScript Labs Repository

Welcome to the JavaScript Labs repository! This repository contains a series of JavaScript labs that cover various concepts and skills. Each lab is designed to help you practice and enhance your JavaScript programming abilities.

## Labs Overview

<!-- Lab1 -->
### Lab 1: Simple trail using prompt and alert
<!-- ![Lab 1](./images/lab1.png) -->

**Description:**
The lab is divide in to two parts

**First Part:**
Ask the user to enter his first name
Ask the user to enter his last name
Confirm the full name.
Ask the user to enter his birth year.

Ask the user to enter the first number
Ask the user to enter second number
Show the summation result (ex: 30 + 6 = 36)

<!-- Lab2 -->
### Lab 2: Age validation, Vowels counter and 24 hour clock to 12 Conventer
<!-- ![Lab 1](./images/lab1.png) -->

**Description:**
The lab is divide in to three parts

**First Part:**
Ask the user to enter his age. You must validate the user input (positive numbers only)
 Show the status of the user knowing that
 Child is between 1-10
 Teenager is between 11-18
 Grown up is between 19-50
 Old is greater than 50
 keep asking the user to enter another age until he clicks cancel 

**Second Part:**
Ask the user to enter a string
 Count the number of vowels in that string (a,e,o,u,i) 

**Third Part:**
Write a JavaScript program to convert the 24 hour clock to 12 , adding am or pm based on its value.
 Examples 
0 -> 12AM,
 11 -> 11AM,
 13 -> 1PM

<!-- Lab3 -->
### Lab 2: Age validation, Vowels counter and 24 hour clock to 12 Conventer
<!-- ![Lab 1](./images/lab1.png) -->

**Description:**
The lab is divide in to three parts

**First Part:**

**lab1:** User will enter his Username , Password 
If username = “admin” and password = “421$$” 
Show him message “Welcome login success”
If he entered incorrect username or password
Tell him which data entered wrong

**lab2 (Calc):** 
User will enter first number
Then enter an operation (sum,multi,subtract,division,moduls)
Then enter second number
Then do the operation and show the result to user

User will be able to use the last result to do new operation on it
As example user enter 1 then sum then 3 then show 4 then sum then 5 then show 
9 and so on

**Second Part:**
Ask the user to enter a string
 Count the number of vowels in that string (a,e,o,u,i) 

**Third Part:**
Write a JavaScript program to convert the 24 hour clock to 12 , adding am or pm based on its value.
 Examples 
0 -> 12AM,
 11 -> 11AM,
 13 -> 1PM
